# Friday Night Funkin': Vs. Sour Standalone
![GitHub all releases](https://img.shields.io/github/downloads/craftersshaft/VsSourStandalone/total)

seperated week from my other mod, [Vs. Kiku](https://github.com/craftersshaf/FNF-Vs-Kiku). uses [Kade Engine](https://github.com/KadeDev/Kade-Engine) as a base. [You can play on html5 here.](http://hedgehogstew.today/VsSourStandalone/)

# notice
this has no affilation with the Olivia Rodrigo album named SOUR. this is just another OC mod with dumb lore.


# The Story
Boyfriend and Girlfriend find themselves at a factory tour of a snack company, when suddenly something goes wrong in the product testing room... Sour, the bossy and snarky temmie challenges the duo to a rap battle!
